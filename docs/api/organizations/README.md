# Organizations

_Note: Access levels vary within organizations. Each route will have its own access level._

_Also: All admins and managers are verified that their organization matches the `org_id` of the request. So managers and admins of organizations not matching `org_id` do not have access._

_Also: Admins are automatically given manager access. So routes with access level of 'managers only' applies to admins as well._
